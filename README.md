=

Based on ```rtfeldman/elm-css```, this package will eventually provide **typesafe** and responsive-by-nature layout of Html, based on the **CSS Grid specification**

See ```examples/``` folder for usage.

*** [CSS Grid Specification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) is the easiest way, to layout your HTML and make it responsive ***

*** [CSS Grid Tutorial](https://scrimba.com/g/gR8PTE) is one of the best interactive tutorials for CSS Grid ***

*** [CSS Grid Reference](https://tympanus.net/codrops/css_reference/grid/) is also a nice reference for CSS Grid ***
